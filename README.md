This will create the flutter folder on the desktop, and inside that folder, it creates a flutter project named `flutter_project `
,
Now run on cmd
```
cd flutter_project
code .
```

## Deployment of my code to your project

To deploy this project, run

```
  1. open lib\main.dart in your project
  2. Copy my code and paste it into that file
  3. Select your emulator with the help of the extension
  4. Start debugging

The emulator will start running your app. Like this, you can practice
